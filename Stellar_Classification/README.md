# üåå Stellar Classification using SDSS Spectral Data (Galaxy, Star, Quasar)

This project focuses on classifying celestial objects‚Äî**galaxies**, **stars**, and **quasars**‚Äîbased on their **photometric and spectral characteristics**. Using machine learning models trained on enhanced feature representations, we aim to distinguish object types captured by the Sloan Digital Sky Survey.

## üìÑ About the Dataset

The dataset originates from the [Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS)](https://www.kaggle.com/fedesoriano/stellar-classification-dataset-sdss17) and contains **100,000 observations**, each described by multiple bandpass measurements and identifiers.

- **Target Variable**: `class` ‚Äî One of `GALAXY`, `STAR`, or `QSO` (quasar)
- **Original Features**:
  - Photometric magnitudes: `u`, `g`, `r`, `i`, `z` (ultraviolet to infrared)
  - Redshift (`redshift`), observation metadata (`plate`, `fiberID`, `run`, `MJD`)
- **Source**:
  - Fedesoriano (2022). [Kaggle Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/fedesoriano/stellar-classification-dataset-sdss17)

## üîß Preprocessing

### Dropped the following identifier columns and uninformative features:
'obj_ID','alpha','delta','run_ID','rerun_ID','cam_col','field_ID','fiber_ID','spec_obj_ID', 'plate', 'MJD'

### Encoded class
'GALAXY':0, 'STAR':1, 'QSO': 2

### Removed extreme or non-physical observations:
- u (ultraviolet magnitude) was required to be greater than 13 and greater than -4000
- g (green magnitude) was required to be greater than 12 and less than 27.5
- z (infrared magnitude) was required to be greater than 11 and less than 24.5
- r (red magnitude) was limited to values less than 26
- i (near-infrared magnitude) was limited to values less than 2

| Feature Name                                     | Description                                                                                        |
| ------------------------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `u_g`                                            | Difference between UV and green magnitudes; lower values suggest hotter stars.                     |
| `g_r`                                            | Green to red difference; tracks color temperature across visible spectrum.                         |
| `r_i`                                            | Red to near-IR difference; useful for tracking cooler stellar objects.                             |
| `i_z`                                            | Near-IR to IR difference; sensitive to late-type stars or dust-rich galaxies.                      |
| `u_r`                                            | UV to red difference; combines hot and cool band regions for broader contrast.                     |
| `g_z`                                            | Green to IR spread; captures steep color transitions across spectrum.                              |
| `mean_flux`                                      | Mean brightness across all five filters; correlates with total luminosity.                         |
| `max_flux`                                       | Brightest observed band; identifies dominant spectral region.                                      |
| `min_flux`                                       | Faintest observed band; useful for measuring flux contrast.                                        |
| `flux_range`                                     | Difference between max and min flux; shows dynamic range of brightness.                            |
| `slope_u_z`                                      | Normalized gradient between UV and IR; estimates overall color slope.                              |
| `photometric_curvature`                          | Curvature across g‚Äìr‚Äìi bands; non-zero indicates color bending, useful for separating quasars.     |
| `red_blue_ratio`                                 | IR (i+z) vs UV/green (u+g); separates red/blue dominated objects (e.g. galaxies vs quasars).       |
| `color_std`                                      | Standard deviation of all magnitudes; high variance can indicate variability or dust.              |
| `r_band_centered`                                | Deviation of red band from average of adjacent bands (g and i); isolates local flux shifts.        |
| `u_frac`, `g_frac`, `r_frac`, `i_frac`, `z_frac` | Percent contribution of each band to total flux; encodes where the object's light is concentrated. |
| `flux_kurtosis`                                  | Sharpness of the flux distribution across bands; high values indicate peak-dominated light.        |
| `color_curvature`                                | Cumulative 2nd derivative across color bands; strong curvature may suggest unusual spectra.        |
| `tilt`                                           | Shift from blue side (u+g) to red side (i+z); positive tilt suggests older/redder objects.         |
| `flux_entropy`                                   | Entropy of normalized fluxes; low values = concentrated energy, high = evenly spread.              |
